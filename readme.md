## Installation
## Step 1 – Programming Language
If Python 3 isn't installed on your machine, you can find it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Step 2 – Language Dependencies
#### We need to install 2 Python dependencies for the program to run.
* ### Option A – Run "install.sh" to install the dependencies automatically.
* ### Option B – Install dependencies manually with pip using PyPi packages links provided below.
    * ### [Requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests)
    * **Requests** allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data — but nowadays, just use the json method!
    * ### [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4)
    * **Beautiful Soup** is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
