# Express Terminal Bible
### by FBH


## Installation
### Programming Language
If Python 3 isn't installed on your machine, you can find it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Language Dependencies
**Requests:** https://pypi.org/project/requests/
Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data — but nowadays, just use the json method!

**BeautifulSoup4:** https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/
Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
